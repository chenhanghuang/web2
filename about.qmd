My name is Chenhang Huang, a junior double majoring in statistics and book and media study at the University of Toronto. I am from China and my hobbies include listening to podcasts, making videos and learning about fashion. I've owned a clothing brand for half a year, and I've been able to sell around 300,000 dollars in sales through my design and marketing and social media operations.
